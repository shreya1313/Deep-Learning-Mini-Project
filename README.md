# Deep-Learning-Mini-Project


## Goal

##### Coming up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR- 10 image classification dataset, under the constraint that your model has no more than 5 million parameters.

## Our Proposed Architecture

## Repository Structure

`models/` \\
  - `.py` files - contains all the model architecture we experimented on using grid search, hyperparameters were tuned, and configurations were employed. \\
  - `.ipynb` - contains code for running all the models (total - 45 models) for different Learning rates and optimizers. \\ 
`ResNet_on_CIFAR10_mod.ipynb` - contains code for the most accurate model. \\
